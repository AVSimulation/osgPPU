First you have to compile the library:
	make

Specify prefix to be used for include and libraries search paths
	make prefix=/path/as/prefix

To install library type:
	make install (to install into default directory /usr/local)
	make prefix=/path/to/install install (to install into another directory)


To run example go into src/example and type:
	make (if you have installed the library somewhere else, then add prefix=/path/to/install)
	./osgppu

The ogsppu example application has to be executed from the src/example
directory, since it access the files in src/example/Data directory
