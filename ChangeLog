	* [r31]
	  CMake install module added

2008-01-17 13:23  art

	* [r30]
	  From "Stephane Lamoliatte"
	  - CMake build system to support builds on multiple platforms.
	  - CMake configured in the way that this compiles under Windows
	  Visual Studio 8
	  - Bug fix in the PostProcess.cpp which cause segfault on Windows.

2008-01-13 01:06  art

	* [r29]
	  - Naming convention changed
	  - Example application ow runs two times faster

2008-01-11 14:27  art

	* [r28]
	  - CFLAGS changed from -g to -O2, now example runs with around
	  400FPS (cessnafire.osg)

2008-01-11 14:26  art

	* [r27]
	  - Example: FPS-Counter added back, on nVidia GeForce 8800Ultra
	  the run of ./osgppu Data/cessnafire.osg gives around 350FPS

2008-01-11 14:21  art

	* [r26]
	  - Text Wrapper class removed. PPUText is now derived directly
	  from osgText::Text

2008-01-09 18:53  art

	* [r25]
	  - Some hacks commented out for now, maybe commit a patch to osg
	  to support them through StateSets

2008-01-09 15:47  art

	* [r24]
	  - Some bugs and issues with the new driver corrected
	  - In example changed all the occurencies of texture2DLod to
	  texture2D
	  Due to some bugs either in the driver or somewhere else texture2D
	  do not read from the level 0 per default.
	  - Therefor had to add glTexParameteri to change the base level of
	  the texture
	  for input textures in the PPUInOut.cpp
	  - Maybe some patch to osg is required to control this by the
	  stateset
	  
	  - Eye Adaption still do not work as one might expected, however
	  the code is correct now.
	  
	  - I am not sure but better to check if ComputeLuminance
	  mipmapshader does work properly

2008-01-09 00:34  art

	* [r23]
	  - g_MimapLevel changed into float
	  - g_MipmapLevelNum uniform added

2008-01-09 00:32  art

	* [r22]
	  - Bugfixes with the new nVidia driver 167.07 corrected
	  - Shader source for the example application corrected to support
	  Shader Model 3.0
	  - Structure of the example ppus changed. Now there is two offline
	  ppus which
	  do compute the adapted luminance value.
	  
	  - TODO: Adapted luminance value seems to have some problems. Will
	  be corrected soon.

2008-01-08 14:37  art

	* [r21]
	  - Small changes to the readme file

2008-01-07 15:53  art

	* [r20]
	  - Hack with unbounded textures is solved
	  - Shaders and ppus seems to work now fine, my another application
	  (refEiko), works now also fine with osgPPU
	  - example application slightly changed

2008-01-07 13:00  art

	* [r19]
	  - small changes in the example application
	  - small changes in the interface of PostProcess and
	  PostProcessUnit
	  - small addings in the documentation
	  - footer.html added to generate doxygen documentation

	* [r18]
	  - Documentation changes

2008-01-07 11:10  art

	* [r17]
	  - UniformMap type removed from PostProcessUnit
	  - META_Object() get an semicolon afterwars, so that doxygen is
	  able to parse

2008-01-07 11:05  art

	* [r16]
	  - Documentation changed
	  - A lot of methods were inlined
	  - Some slightly changes in the interface

	* [r15]
	  - example: Setup material of teapot instead of direct call of
	  glColor

2008-01-07 09:48  art

	* [r14]
	  - PPUInOut.cpp g_TextureWidth and g_TextureHeight changed into
	  g_ViewportWidth and g_ViewportHeight
	  - example shaders changed from Shader Model 4 to Shader Model 3,
	  exampel application should now also work on GeForce 6xxx
	  - example: Teapot as default model added

2008-01-07 00:39  art

	* [r13]
	  - Documentaion through doxygen added
	  - Licence header changed
	  - Small bugfixes
	  - Example application includes some more features

2008-01-06 19:04  art

	* [r12]
	  - osgppu Example is now almost complete. It shows how to use
	  osgPPU to setup
	  a proper HDR rendering pipeline
	  
	  - some minor bugfixes in PPUs
	  
	  - There are still some problems with ppu which do use textures
	  and shader
	  Textures has to be bound manually by hand, stateset semms not to
	  settted up properly

2008-01-05 00:35  art

	* [r11]
	  - Example application created
	  - some changes in the PPUText done
	  - PostProcess can now be used in the osg graph by specifying the
	  camera drawcallback method
	  - some bugfixes

2008-01-04 12:14  art

	* [r10]
	  problems with blending corrected
	  PPUText were added
	  Text class as wrapper was also added
